# Intelligent Alert Escalation And Resolution System

## Overview

This project implements a rule-driven alert lifecycle management system that handles creation, escalation, resolution, and automated closure of operational alerts.

The idea is to simulate how real-world fleet monitoring or operations systems behave — where alerts are not just stored, but actively processed based on rules.

It supports scenarios like overspeed events, compliance checks, and negative feedback tracking, with a focus on lifecycle tracking, rule evaluation, and visibility through a dashboard.

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- Node.js (ES Modules)
- Express
- MongoDB (Mongoose)
- Redis (used for caching dashboard data)
- node-cron (for scheduled background jobs)

### Frontend
- React
- Chart.js
- Axios

---

## Core Features

### Alert Lifecycle

Each alert moves through a defined lifecycle:

OPEN → ESCALATED → AUTO_CLOSED / RESOLVED

Every transition is stored in a history log so the full lifecycle can be traced.

---

### Rule-Based Escalation

Alerts are escalated when:
- Same driverId + sourceType
- Within a configured time window
- Count crosses threshold

On escalation:
- Status → ESCALATED
- Severity → CRITICAL
- History updated

Rules are defined in a JSON config, so behavior can be adjusted without changing code.

---

### Auto-Close Engine

A background job runs periodically and checks:

- Compliance-based condition (e.g. document_valid = true)
- Expiry window (alert becomes stale after some time)

If conditions match, alert is moved to AUTO_CLOSED.

---

### Dashboard

The system exposes APIs for:
- Severity summary
- Top drivers
- Trends over time
- Recent auto-closed alerts
- Active rule configuration

---

## Architecture

Routes → Controllers → Services → Models

---

## Caching Strategy

Redis is used for:
- Severity summary
- Top drivers

Cache is invalidated on alert updates.

---

## Time & Space Complexity

- Alert Creation: O(1)
- Escalation: O(log n)
- Auto-Close Job: O(m)
- Dashboard Aggregation: O(n)

---

## Design Trade-offs

- Used cron instead of event-driven system (simpler, slight delay)
- JSON rules instead of DB (flexible but not dynamic reload)
- Partial caching (simpler invalidation)
- Simplicity over full scalability

---

## Failure Handling

- Centralized error handler
- Logging with Winston
- Redis fallback handling

---

## How to Run

Create .env file with:
PORT=5000  
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string  
REDIS_HOST=your_redis_host  
REDIS_PORT=your_redis_port  
REDIS_PASSWORD=your_redis_password  

Run:
npm install  
npm run dev  

---

## API Endpoints

Alerts:
POST /api/v1/alerts  
GET /api/v1/alerts/:alertId  
PATCH /api/v1/alerts/:alertId/resolve  

Dashboard:
GET /api/v1/dashboard/summary  
GET /api/v1/dashboard/top-drivers  
GET /api/v1/dashboard/trends  
GET /api/v1/dashboard/recent-auto-closed  
GET /api/v1/dashboard/rules  

---

## Final Notes

This project focuses on building a system that actively manages alerts using rules, background processing, and analytics.
